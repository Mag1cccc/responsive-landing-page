                <h3>Volleyball</h3>
                <p>volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side,
                    in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net,
                    trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents’ playing area before it can be returned.
                    To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court
                    surface—that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net.
                    A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.</p>

                <h3>Beach volleyball</h3>
                <p>Beach Volleyball is an outdoor sand-based court sport played between two teams of two.
                    The aim of the game is to hit an inflated ball over a net that hangs high at the centre of the court and make it land in the opposition's half.
                     Beach Volleyball originated in Hawaii around 1915, and began to surface in Europe in the 1930s.</p>

                <h3>Snow volleyball</h3>
                <p>What is Snow Volleyball? Snow Volleyball is a 3 on 3 sport played on a rectangular 16m x 8m court of compacted snow.
                     For competitions, the snow must be at least 30cm deep. 
                     The Snow Volleyball game objective is for a team to score points by delivering the ball over the net and on to the ground of the opposing side’s court,
                      much like traditional indoor or beach volleyball.</p>
